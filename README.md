[PryRemoteEm](https://rubygems.org/gems/pry-remote-em) enables you to
start instances of Pry in a running
[EventMachine](http://rubyeventmachine.com/) program and connect to
those Pry instances over a network or the Internet. Once connected you
can interact with the internal state of the program.

It's based off of [Mon-Ouie's](https://github.com/Mon-Ouie) [pry-remote](https://github.com/Mon-Ouie/pry-remote) for DRb.

It adds user authentication and SSL support along with tab-completion
and paging. It's compatble with MRI 1.9, or any other VM with support
for Fibers and EventMachine.


# Installation

```bash
gem install pry-remote-em
```

# Usage

```ruby
require 'pry-remote-em/server'

class Foo
  def initialize(x, y)
    binding.remote_pry_em
  end
end

EM.run { Foo.new 10, 20 }
```

Running it will print out a message telling you Pry is waiting for a
program to connect itself to it:

     [pry-remote-em] listening for connections on pryem://127.0.0.1:6462/

You can then connect to the pry session using ``pry-remote-em``:

    $ pry-remote-em pryem://127.0.0.1:6462/
    [pry-remote-em] client connected to pryem://127.0.0.1:6462/
    [pry-remote-em] remote is PryRemoteEm 0.1.0

    [5] pry(#<Foo>)> x = 12
    => 12

    [6] pry(#<Foo>)> x
    => 12

    [7] pry(#<Foo>)> exit
    [pry-remote-em] session terminated

    $ pry-remote-em pryem://127.0.0.1:6462/
    [pry-remote-em] client connected to pryem://127.0.0.1:6462/
    [pry-remote-em] remote is PryRemoteEm 0.1.0
    [1] pry(#<Foo>)> x
    => 12

    [2] pry(#<Foo>)> exit
    [pry-remote-em] session terminated

# Features

## Multiple Servers

It's easy to run more than one PryRemoteEm service on a single machine,
or even in the same process. When you start the service via
*#remote_pry_em*, just specify *:auto* as the port to use. The service
will automatically take the next free port from 6462.

```ruby
require "pry-remote-em/server"

os     = ObjectSpace.each_object
expose = []
while expose.length < 5
  o = os.next
  expose.push(o) unless o.frozen?
end

EM.run {
  expose.each {|o| o.remote_pry_em('localhost', :auto) }
}
```

    $ ruby test/auto-demo.rb

```

## Server Broker

When more than one server is running on a given host and each server is
started with :auto it can be time consuming to manually figure out which
port each server is running on. The Broker which listens on port 6462
keeps track of which server is running on which port.

By default the pry-remote-em cli utility will connect to the broker and
retrieve a list of known servers. You can then select one to connect to
by its id, name or url. You can also choose to proxy your connection
through the broker to the selected server.

```shell

$ bin/pry-remote-em
[pry-remote-em] client connected to pryem://127.0.0.1:6462/
[pry-remote-em] remote is PryRemoteEm 0.7.0 pryem

By default the Broker will listen on 127.0.0.1:6462. To change the ip
address that the Broker binds to specify it in a PRYEMBROKER environment
variable, or in :broker_host option passed to #remote_pry_em.

```shell

```

It is possible to have a pry-remote-em server register with a Broker
running on a different host. Just specify the Brokers address in the
PRYEMBROKER environment variable or the :broker_host option passed to #remote_pry_em.

To connect to a broker running on a seperate host with the cli client
just specify it on the command line ``bin/pry-remote-em preym://10.0.0.2:6462/``.
You can then proxy your client connections to remote servers through
that Broker.

The Broker will not run in TLS mode, but it can proxy connections to a
TLS enabled server.


## TLS Encryption

When creating a server pass the :tls => true option to enable TLS.

```ruby
obj.remote_pry_em('localhost', :auto, :tls => true)
```

If you pass a Hash it will be used to configure the internal TLS handler.

```ruby
obj.remote_pry_em('localhost', :auto, :tls => {:private_key_file => '/tmp/server.key'})
```
See [EventMachine::Connection#start_tls](http://eventmachine.rubyforge.org/EventMachine/Connection.html#M000296) for the available options.


When the command line client connects to a TLS enabled server it will
automatically use TLS mode even if the user didn't request it.

```bash
$ pry-remote-em pryem://localhost:6462/
[pry-remote-em] client connected to pryem://127.0.0.1:6462/
[pry-remote-em] remote is PryRemoteEm 0.4.0 pryems
[pry-remote-em] negotiating TLS
[pry-remote-em] TLS connection established
[1] pry(#<Hash>)>
```

To always require a TLS connection give pry-remote-em a pryem*s* URL. If
the server doesn't support TLS the connection will be terminated.

```bash
$ pry-remote-em pryems://localhost:6468/
[pry-remote-em] client connected to pryem://127.0.0.1:6468/
[pry-remote-em] remote is PryRemoteEm 0.4.0 pryem
[pry-remote-em] connection failed
[pry-remote-em] server doesn't support required scheme "pryems"
[pry-remote-em] session terminated
```


## User Authentication

### Server

 If the service is started with the :auth option it will require all
clients to authenticate on connect. The :auth option can be a Hash, proc
or any object that responds to #call.

#### Auth with a Hash
```ruby
auth_hash = {'caleb' => 'crane', 'john' => 'lowski'}
obj       = {:encoding => __ENCODING__, :weather => :cloudy}
EM.run{
  obj.remote_pry_em('localhost', :auto, :tls => true, :auth => auth_hash)
}
```

#### Auth with a lambda
```ruby
require 'net/ldap'
ldap_anon = lambda do |user, pass|
  ldap = Net::LDAP.new :host => '10.0.0.1', :port => 389, :auth => {:method => :simple, :username => user, :password => pass}
  ldap.bind
end
obj       = {:encoding => __ENCODING__, :weather => :cloudy}
EM.run{
  obj.remote_pry_em('localhost', :auto, :tls => true, :auth => ldap_anon)
}
```

#### Auth with an object
```ruby
class Authenticator
  def initialize(db)
    @db = db
  end
  def call(user, pass)
    @db[user] && @db[user] == pass
  end
end

obj       = {:encoding => __ENCODING__, :weather => :cloudy}
EM.run{
  obj.remote_pry_em('localhost', :auto, :tls => true, :auth => Authenticator.new(auth_hash))
}
```


### Client

The included command line client ``pry-remote-em`` can take a username
and/or password as part of the url argument. If either a username or
password is not supplied, but required by the server it will prompt for
them.

```shell
$ pry-remote-em pryems://localhost:6464/
[pry-remote-em] client connected to pryem://127.0.0.1:6464/
[pry-remote-em] remote is PryRemoteEm 0.4.0 pryems
[pry-remote-em] negotiating TLS
[pry-remote-em] TLS connection established
user: caleb
caleb's password: *****
[1] pry(#<Hash>)>
```


```shell
$ pry-remote-em pryems://caleb@localhost:6464
[pry-remote-em] client connected to pryem://127.0.0.1:6464/
[pry-remote-em] remote is PryRemoteEm 0.4.0 pryems
[pry-remote-em] negotiating TLS
[pry-remote-em] TLS connection established
caleb's password: *****
[1] pry(#<Hash>)> exit
```

```shell
$ pry-remote-em pryems://caleb:crane@localhost:6464
[pry-remote-em] client connected to pryem://127.0.0.1:6464/
[pry-remote-em] remote is PryRemoteEm 0.4.0 pryems
[pry-remote-em] negotiating TLS
[pry-remote-em] TLS connection established
[1] pry(#<Hash>)> exit
```


## Tab Completion

  Tab completion candidates will be retrieved from the server and
presented on the client side.

```ruby
$ bin/pry-remote-em pryems:///
[pry-remote-em] client connected to pryem://127.0.0.1:6462/
[pry-remote-em] remote is PryRemoteEm 0.2.0 pryems
[1] pry(#<Hash>)> key (^TAB ^TAB)
key   key?  keys
[1] pry(#<Hash>)> keys
=> [:encoding]
```

## Paging

The standard Pry pager is supported through the included client.

```ruby
[1] pry(#<Hash>)> ENV
=> {"COMMAND_MODE"=>"unix2003",
 "DISPLAY"=>"/tmp/launch-0EGhJW/org.x:0",
 "EDITOR"=>"mvim -f --nomru -c \"au VimLeave * !open -a Terminal\"",
 "GEM_HOME"=>"/Users/caleb/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p290",
 "GEM_PATH"=>
  "/Users/caleb/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p290:/Users/caleb/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p290@global",
 "GREP_COLOR"=>"1;32",
 "GREP_OPTIONS"=>"--color=auto",
 "HOME"=>"/Users/caleb",
 "IRBRC"=>"/Users/caleb/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p290/.irbrc",
 "LC_CTYPE"=>"",
 "LOGNAME"=>"caleb",
 "LSCOLORS"=>"Gxfxcxdxbxegedabagacad",
:
```

## Messaging
It is possible for each pry-remote-em service to host multiple
simultaneous connections. You can send messages to other connections
with the '!' and '!!' prefix.

The '!' prefix will send the message to connections on the same object.
the '!!' prefix will send the message to all connections in the current
process.

Message will not be displayed by the clients until the presses enter.

## Authentication Event Callbacks
Available events are:

 - auth_attempt - called each time authentication is attempted
 - auth_fail    - called each time authentication fails
 - auth_ok      - called each time authentication succeeds

```ruby
log         = ::Logger.new('/var/log/auth.pry.log')
obj.new.remote_pry_em('0.0.0.0', :auto, :tls => true, :auth => auth_hash) do |pry|
  pry.auth_attempt do |user, ip|
    log.info("got an authentication attempt for #{user} from #{ip}")
  end
  pry.auth_fail do |user, ip|
    log.fatal("failed authentication attempt for #{user} from #{ip}")
  end
  pry.auth_ok do |user, ip|
    log.info("successful authentication for #{user} from #{ip}")
  end
end
```

## Shell Commands
If the pry-remote-em service is started with the ``:allow_shell_cmds =>
true`` option set it will spawn sub processes for any command prefixed
with a '.'.

```
[1] pry(#<#<Class:0x007fe0be072618>>)> .uname -a
Darwin kiff.local 11.3.0 Darwin Kernel Version 11.3.0: Thu Jan 12 18:47:41 PST 2012; root:xnu-1699.24.23~1/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64
```

Interactive commands like ``vim`` will probably not behave
appropriately.


If the server was not started with the ``allow_shell_cmds`` option then
all shell commands will be met with a rejection notice.

```
[1] pry(#<#<Class:0x007fe0be072618>>)> .ls
shell commands are not allowed by this server
```

The server will also log whenever a user attempts to execute a shell
command.

```
